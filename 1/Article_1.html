    <p align="justify" style="font-size: 75px; color:#b56580; margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px; margin-top:0px;"> The weirdest thing happened to me these last months,
        I was in a slump, a really deep one. A downward spiral filled with 
        anxiousness and stress about basically everything. <br>
        Why? <br>
        I have no idea. I think it's just me, I make too much of things, like the future for instance.
        I don't like uncertainty, so I do everything in my power to ensure a 90% sucess rate. 
        Except, failure can't be avoided, really. No matter how hard I try at..whatever,
        I'm bound to fail at some point 
        But I didn't know that, until a few months ago. 
        I've always attached myself worth to what I can give, naturally, 
        I grew a tiny person inside my head  
        telling me that I'm better than a lot of people because I do things better than them.
        Sure, I have my strong points, but this arrogance, which no one knew of, made me suffer. <br>
        I thought I deserved the elite spots, wherever I was, except I'm not special. <br>
        Appling to college abroad is teaching me something, that - yes - hard work is GOOD, shows that you're
        smart.. but it doesn't really mean anything. <br>
        Life was never about what we "produce", what we are, it's about experiencing : the good, the horrible 
        and the average. <br>
        This helped me realize that  sometimes my goals won't be reached, that I shouldn't EXPECT the world
        give to me just because I asked of it. <br>
        That's why I'm good now, with having drawbacks, messing up from time to time, taking days off.
        I'ts not that I don't care, It's that im not  THAT inconvinienced by it anymore.<br>
        I still have that competitive bone in me, but another dog borrowing it for the day doesn't set me on edge
        anymore. <br>
        Well, that's all 
    </p>
